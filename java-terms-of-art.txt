 Anatomy of a Java Program:

Defintions:
3. Method - a method is a function that is apart of class
class Main {
    void main () {
    }
}
2. Class - A container for one or more related functions; helps organize codes.

class Main {
    void main () {
    }
}

* the functions between a  class is a method*

1. Function - A function is the smallest block of code in java that can perform a specific task; n java.
      void main () {
        }

*main is the entry point to java programs*
Whenever a java program is run the main function is called and the code inside gets executed
*a funciton should never be alone and should always belong to a class*

All classes and methods should have a access modifier- a special keyword that determines if other classes and methods
can access these classes and methods  ex( public & private)
Ex:
 public class Main {
    public void main() {

    }
 }

 When naming classes we use the PascalNamingConvention
 When naming methods we use the camelNamingConvention
